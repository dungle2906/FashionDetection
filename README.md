# Fashion Object Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview

This project implements YOLOv8 for fashion object detection, enabling the identification and classification of clothing items in images. The model can be used for various applications, including fashion e-commerce, virtual try-ons, and AI-powered outfit recommendations.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detects and classifies clothing items in images.
- **YOLOv8-based Model**: Utilizes the latest YOLO architecture for real-time detection.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Supports CUDA for faster inference and training.
- **Custom Training**: Can be fine-tuned on specific fashion datasets.

## Dataset

The model can be trained on public datasets like DeepFashion or Custom Fashion Datasets. Ensure your dataset follows the YOLO format with labeled bounding boxes.

## Results
